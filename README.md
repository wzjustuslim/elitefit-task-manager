# Simple Task Manager

## Coding Test:

### Objective:
- Develop a straightforward task management application. The emphasis is on core functionality and a user-friendly interface.

### Core Features:
- Dashboard: P2
  - Upon accessing the application, users see a basic dashboard displaying a list of tasks.
  - Include sections for upcoming tasks, overdue tasks, and completed tasks.
- Task Management: P1
  - Users can add, edit, and delete tasks.
  - Tasks should include a title, description, due date, priority level.
- Priority Levels: P3
  - Define three priority levels for tasks (e.g., High, Medium, Low).
  - Users can set and update the priority of each task.
- Search and Filter: P4
  - Implement a search functionality to find tasks quickly.
  - Allow users to filter tasks based on priority and completion status.

### Technical Requirements:
- Frontend
  - Use a lightweight frontend framework (e.g., Vanilla JavaScript, React, or Vue.js).
  - Implement a simple and clean user interface.
- Local Storage
  - Store task data locally using browser storage (localStorage or sessionStorage).

## Technical Questions:
Please answer the following questions in a markdown file called: Answers to technical questions.md.

- How long did you spend on the coding test? 
- What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.
- How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
- If you had more time, what additional features or improvements would you consider adding to the task management application?

## Submission Guidelines:
- Code Submission:
  - You are expected to submit a well-organised codebase via a version control system (e.g., GitHub).
  - Include clear instructions on setting up and running the application.
- Documentation:
  - Include a README.md file with an overview of the project, setup instructions, and any additional information.
  - Document any assumptions made during the development process.
- Demo:
  - Optionally, you may provide a link to a live demo of the application.
